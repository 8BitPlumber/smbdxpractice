<h3>How to use</h3>
<p>Provided is a folder with Z80 ASM files, and an ips patch. The ASM files are the changes made on a US disassemble, while the patch is those changes hex edited into the Japanese version. The Japanese version is used for speedrunning and therefore it is recommended to use the patch. To patch, simply go to https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/ and upload your rom and the ips.</p>

<p>If anyone want to help convert anything from the US to Japanese version, or just add new functionality, contact me on discord at https://discord.com/users/1215822081527255131</p>

<p>Good luck on all your speedrunning adventures! Enjoy!</p>
